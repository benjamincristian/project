# project
In this project I am building a blog website using the django framework. 
Features:
-Possibility for the owner to create new posts (CreateView)
-Possibility for the owner to update the posts (UpdateView)
-Possibility for the owner to delete the posts (DeleteView)
-The owner has a fancy text editor in the admin access area
-Sign in/Log in button
-Like/Dislike button
-Newer posts appear on the top of the page
-The users have the possibility to leave a comment under the posts
-New users when they create an account, if they enter an already existing email or username, they will be informed in the sign-in form





-New users don't have access to the posts, thus to the comments, like and dislikes until they sign in
