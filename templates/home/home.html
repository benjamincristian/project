                    Welcome! Or welcome back if you already knew about this site! This website was made as a final
                    project by a student. You can admire all the beautiful functionalities that have been implemented
                    and try them out. You can sign in if you don't have an account or log in if you already have one.
                    You can read all the posts you want and if you like them you can leave a comment and a like, or a
                    dislike and a comment where you point out what you didn't like about that specific post, because we
                    want the people to know if a post is worth reading or not.
                    Maybe you are here because you are sick of this blog and you want to delete your account.
                    You can, we won't stop you! <br>Enjoy your stay!
